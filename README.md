Project Agenda: Establish a connection between Snowflake and Tableau to publish analysis.

Procedure Followed: Cleaned and transferred four tables from Stage Schema to Prod Schema in Snowflake. Relationships between tables established for unified data access. Six visualizations created including heatmap, geo-map, bar chart, bubble chart, line graph, and pie chart. Actions implemented for Geo Map and Reset Button.

Brief Interpretation: Dataset consists of 200 customers and 250 orders. California and Texas lead in order amounts, number of orders, and customers. Sales and order quantity trends consistent in 2022 and 2023.

The interactive dashboard is published on Tableau Public, accessible via provided link.
